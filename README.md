# Maritime-Wave-Simulation
Final year project for Bachelor of Computer Science

This software aims to provide a realistic simulation of open sea conditions, and their interactions with a ship model.
The user is able to toggle between varying types of waves and change wind speed settings as per the [Beaufort Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale). 

## Getting started
### System requirements
The minimum recommended hardware specifications as per the [Unreal Engine Wiki](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Recommended_Hardware) are:

+ Desktop PC or Mac
+ Windows 7 64-bit or Mac OS X 10.9.2 or later
+ Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or faster
+ NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card or higher
+ 8 GB RAM

### Downloading and installing Unreal Engine 4

1. [Download](https://www.unrealengine.com/download) the Epic Games desktop application
2. Sign in or create a free Epic Games account
3. Once signed in, download the **Unreal Engine 4.17** version through the application. Please make sure that you download the **4.17 version** as it is required to run the project

### Opening and running the project
1. After installing the engine, launch it
2. Create a new project using the **Blueprint Basic** option, with starter content
3. Once the new project has launched, go to the Unreal launcher again. Your newly created
project should appear in Library under **My Projects**. Right click "Show in Folder"
4. Navigate to the **Content** folder of the new project, copy and paste the **Physical Water Surface** folder there
5. Close and re-launch the project. The folder you added should now appear
6. To run the project, go to the **Content** folder, click the **WindSpeedDemo** file, and click "Play" on the top bar
7. Press **Shift + F1** in your keyboard to enable the cursorand interact with the simulation
